ML Project
The strategy of providing historic and predictive insights to the planning department helps them to effective the planning process to streamline the operations to prevent catastrophic incidents occur in the company units. 

To provide historical analysis to the planning department about the insights of past incident data. In addition to structured data, unstructured data is present in the form of PDF documents for each incident. This is also to be considered for the prediction of fatal accidents along with structured data.

To provide predictive analysis to the planning department about the factors which contribute majorly to the fatal accidents and to show the predictive results about the fatal accidents cases.  

The objective of this project is:
1.	To provide the analysis of accidents based on structured and unstructured data.
2.	To predict fatal accidents based on structured and unstructured data.

Programs:
Capstone1_ML Models - It contains analysis and prediction of structured dataset with classic machine learning models
Capstone2_TFIDF_Naive_Bayes - It contains prediction of structured and unstructured dataset with Naive Bayed with TFIDF
Capstone2_BERT - It contains prediction of structured and unstructured dataset with BERT classifier model
